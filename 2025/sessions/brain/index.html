        <p>
          Jerry Michalski will take you inside Jerry’s Brain — his living, evolving knowledge space that he has been curating for decades. You’ll see how linking ideas changes how we think, remember, and collaborate, and how visual structure helps reveal patterns, context, and opportunities. We’ll explore how personal knowledge tools and trust-centric practices can make teams more resilient and innovative, and how you can apply these principles to your own visual thinking and note‑making.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll cover how to grow a network of ideas over time, ways to keep context without losing details, and practices for sensemaking in fast‑moving environments. You’ll leave with practical ways to start building your own “brain” — a system that scales with your curiosity and helps you act with clarity.
