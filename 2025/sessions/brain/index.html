        <p>
          Jerry Michalski will take you inside Jerry's Brain — his living, evolving knowledge space that he has been curating for decades. You'll see how linking ideas changes how we think, remember, and collaborate, and how visual structure helps reveal patterns, context, and opportunities. We'll explore how personal knowledge tools and trust-centric practices can make teams more resilient and innovative, and how you can apply these principles to your own visual thinking and note-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jerry's been using his external Brain to catalog and examine what he's learned in the 27-plus years he has fed his one mind map. (You can get a sneak peek ahead into his talk by visiting <a href="https://bra.in/4py4oQ" target="_blank">this Thought</a> and browsing around.) While Jerry's use of TheBrain is quite personal and idiosyncratic, you will likely find inspirations among his insights, as you build your own system to support your curiosity.

            <p><strong>Founder, Open Global Mind</strong></p>
            <p>
              Jerry Michalski (ma-CALL-ski) is the founder of
              <a href="http://openglobalmind.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Global Mind</a>, a project to help humans make better decisions together. He is also an expert on trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jerry was on the front lines of the tech revolution for a dozen years as a tech-industry trends analyst during the dot-com boom, as Managing Editor of Esther Dyson’s monthly newsletter, Release 1.0. He also advised corporate advanced-technology groups on whether and where to deploy exponential technologies like machine intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the 4,000-plus startups Jerry interviewed had a useful mind-mapping app called TheBrain. Intrigued, Jerry began curating his Brain then, over 27 years ago. Now it’s the world’s largest, with over 600,000 entries. You can consult that same Brain online, for free,
              <a href="http://jerrysbrain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid-90s, Jerry realized the word “<a href="http://therexpedition.com/2011/06/that-troubling-word-consumer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer</a>” was a linchpin to understanding many of today’s dilemmas. Following “consumer” led him to the concept of trust, specifically the many ways that consumer capitalism has broken trust. More optimistically, he also found groups around the world rediscovering trust to solve thorny problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this mix of movements and ideas, Jerry is creating
              <a href="http://designfromtrust.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design from Trust</a>, a process that can be applied in many different domains. DfT’s home base is Open Global Mind.
