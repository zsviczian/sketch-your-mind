        A Drawing Workshop with Lisa Rothstein

        <h2 id="abstract-title" class="section-title">Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Bring more humanity, story, and feeling into your drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a facilitator, consultant, coach, or visual thinker, this hands-on workshop will help you move beyond stick figures and charts to create drawings that truly connect. Led by New Yorker cartoonist, writer, and visual facilitator Lisa Rothstein, you'll learn simple, expressive techniques to make your visual work come alive with emotion.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title" style="margin-top:1em;">What you'll learn</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Draw faces that express real emotion: joy, frustration, surprise, pride, and more</li>
          <li>Add simple body language and gestures that tell a story</li>
          <li>Capture the emotional content of what people are saying, not just the words</li>
          <li>Choose when and where to bring emotion into your visual notes or illustrations</li>
          <li>Replace lifeless stick figures with quick, expressive characters anyone can draw</li>
          <li>Also, we'll practice drawing animals!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section-title" style="margin-top:1em;">Why it matters</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional expression brings humanity to your visuals. When you show people <em>feeling</em> something — not just <em>doing</em> something — your audience instantly connects. A character straining under the weight of too many tasks says more than a to-do list ever could. A joyful customer sketch communicates success faster than twenty PowerPoint slides.
