        <p>You're already drawn to visual thinking, but something feels off. Maybe your mind maps feel rigid, your sketchnotes seem forced, or you're still struggling to maintain focus as you listen.</p>
        <p>The problem isn't that visual thinking doesn't workâ€”it's that most note-taking methods have built-in limits that weren't designed for how your brain actually processes information.</p>
        <p>Brandy brings her can't-miss combo of lightbulb moment context-setters alongside concrete, repeatable techniques, so you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ðŸ’¥ Grasp the hidden assumptions and cognitive trade-offs built into popular note-taking methods</li>
          <li>â¬œ Discover why a blank sheet of paper is the real engine of focus and flow</li>
          <li>ðŸ‘‚ Recognize which of the 5 Visual Listening skills you're already using (and which you're missing)</li>
          <li>ðŸ§  See exactly how visual thinking supports your executive function</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Time to fix what's been feeling off, and give your brain the fuel it needs.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>
              Brandy Agerbeck has spent 28 years proving that visual thinking isn't a mysterious talentâ€”it's a learnable life skill that can transform how your brain works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Known as "the godmother of visual practice," she's the author of <em>The Graphic Facilitator's Guide</em> and <em>The Idea Shapers</em>, and creator of The Agerbeck Method online course that's created lifelong visual thinkers in over 40 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              More recently, an executive dysfunction diagnosis led Brandy to research, synthesize, and visualize the executive functions for adult audiences. In her workshop <em>Befriend Your Brain</em>, she teaches hands-on visual tools that <s>that</s> help fast, unruly brains find focus and flow â€” and most importantly, <strong>lead you to being kinder to yourself.</strong>
