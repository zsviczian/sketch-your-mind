        <p>
          Have you ever struggled to explain a great idea, only to watch it fall flat? Too often our most valuable insights get lost in complexity or jargon, when what they really need is clarity. In this session, Janis Ozolins will show you how to turn abstract concepts into simple visuals that people immediately get.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 30 minutes, Janis will share the process he's developed—used by creators, entrepreneurs, and business leaders—to break down ideas into their visual essence. He'll cover why visuals work, principles for simplifying information, and practical steps you can use right away to communicate more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the presentation, we'll open the conversation with 20 minutes of interactive Q&A, where you can ask Janis about applying these methods to your own work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll leave this session with concrete techniques to make your ideas more memorable and persuasive—without needing to “be an artist.”

              Janis Ozolins helps people explain ideas visually. His simple but powerful visuals are seen by millions every month, shared by thought leaders and creators worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just a few years ago, Janis was an aspiring online creator struggling to find traction. Then he stumbled into visual communication, and everything changed. Six months later, he left his corporate job, and today his work has grown an audience of 220,000+, led to collaborations with Shaan Puri, Naval Ravikant, Ana Lorena Fabrega, Dharmesh Shah, Matt D'Avella, Julian Shapiro, and Steven Bartlett.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now Janis spends his time creating, freelancing, and teaching others how to turn complex thoughts into simple visuals that resonate. He also leads a course and community where he shows people how to explain their own ideas visually.
